## Introduction
Machine learning has revolutionized various industries by enabling data-driven decision-making. This repository provides a collection of widely used ML libraries, along with installation instructions and basic usage examples.

## Installation
To use the libraries in this repository, ensure you have Python installed. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Libraries Included
This repository covers popular ML libraries such as:

- **Scikit-Learn** – Classical machine learning algorithms
- **TensorFlow** – Deep learning framework by Google
- **PyTorch** – Deep learning framework by Facebook
- **XGBoost** – Optimized gradient boosting library
- **LightGBM** – Fast, distributed, high-performance gradient boosting
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** – Numerical computing
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization

## Usage
Here’s an example of how to use Scikit-Learn for a simple classification task:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load dataset
data = load_iris()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data.data, data.target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```
